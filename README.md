Project 1 Proposal and Summary

Project 1 Name:     Maryland Vaccine Distribution

Project 1 Team: Juan Castaneda, Robin Evans, Clayton Grace

Purpose/Scope:    

1. Access to the Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson vaccines by residents of the state of MD.
2. Discover vaccine availability in the state of MD.
3. Identify vaccination sites based on a given address within MD.
4. Identify the top MD counties with the most participation.

Core Message:    

Our project intends to uncover a resident's ability to access the COVID-19 vaccines currently available in Maryland. The vaccines currently administered are Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. Maryland is currently reporting a dosage rate of $0.7% among its 6,046 million residents. We will evaluate availability, identify sites per location, and site providers within Maryland per our selected data sources.

Predictions:
How soon will Maryland be vaccinated? 25%? 50%?

We predict that MD will reach 25% immunity by June 2021--our data reflects that this will occur in 6.27 months. The data used is linear; therefore, a linear projection model was appropriate and rational. We are confident in our initial predictions. As with most projection models, the near-term predictions are more likely to occur due there being less variability in the short term. However, we feel that our 50% prediction results of show February 2022 (13.8 months), which are not in alignment with governmental experts estimates. Therefore, we feel that it will be less accurate as time progresses due unpredictable decisions by everyone involved.

Questions:

1. How many doses of the vaccine are administered daily in MD?
On average the vaccinations administered daily is approximately 27,495.

2. How much of the vaccine has been distributed in MD?
Total vaccines distributed in MD is 2,390,890.

3. How much of the MD population has received a dose of the vaccine?
Total vaccines administered in MD is 1,812,309.

4. How much of the MD population has been fully vaccinated?
Approximately, 10% of MD is fully vaccinated, as of 3/11/2021.

5. Which MD County is Administering the most vaccine doses?
Montgomery County has administered the most vaccine doses.

6. Where is the closest place to get a vaccine?
Our team created a ‘Site Locator Tool’ within our code through the use of an  API (Google API). We successfully demonstrated the site locations results; however, this tool is not accessible without our private API key. We provided a Gmaps slide highlighting all of the available vaccine site locations within MD as a visual aid.

Summary:

Overall, we were satisfied with the results of data analysis and supporting visualization documentations in our review of vaccine activity in the state of Maryland. In our analysis we were able to determine how Maryland measures up in comparisons across the country, as well as county-by-county. The time-phases data that we used allowed us to track daily activity, draw comparisons of distributed vs. administered doses of the vaccine. We raced some limitations in terms of there being multiple types of vaccines—2 dosage and single dosage. The data did not reveal demographic details; therefore, our analysis was strictly focused on time distribution, and participation.

In comparison to other states, Maryland is in the top 50% of states/territories in regard to vaccines administered. The best performing counties within Maryland are Montgomery, Baltimore County, and Prince George’s County. Maryland has received 2,390,890 vaccines and administered 1,812,309 giving it an average daily rate of 27,495 vaccines being administered daily. To date, approximately, 10% of Maryland is fully vaccinated. Our predication is that Maryland will be at 25% vaccinated by June 2021 (188 days after 1st vaccine) and 50% in February 2022 (414 days after 1st vaccine.

Additionally, we created a ‘Site Locator Tool’ within our code through the use of Gmaps, which can identify the nearest vaccination site when a Maryland address is submitted. Lastly, we feel that Maryland has sufficiently and timely administered the vaccines provided. Our projections are consistent with the US presidential va
